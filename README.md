# DALL-E Agent: AI-Powered Fairy Tale Image Generator

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates an AI-powered system that automatically generates funny fairy tale concepts and creates corresponding images using DALL-E. The system uses CrewAI to orchestrate multiple AI agents working together to create a complete creative workflow.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Three specialized AI agents work together
- **Creative Story Generation**: Generates humorous fairy tale concepts with modern twists
- **Visual Concept Translation**: Converts stories into detailed image descriptions
- **DALL-E Integration**: Automatically generates images from text descriptions
- **Hebrew Interface**: Includes Hebrew comments and output formatting

## Architecture

The system consists of three AI agents:

### 1. Fairy Tale Twister (Creator)
- **Role**: Creative storyteller
- **Goal**: Create short, funny fairy tale concepts with unique modern twists
- **Function**: Takes classic children's stories and gives them humorous updates

### 2. Concept Artist (Conceptualizer)
- **Role**: Visual translator
- **Goal**: Translate stories into vivid image concepts
- **Function**: Captures entire stories in single, detailed image descriptions

### 3. Image Generator (Illustrator)
- **Role**: DALL-E operator
- **Goal**: Generate funny and vivid images based on fairy tale ideas
- **Function**: Uses DALL-E to bring creative visual concepts to life

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have:

1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.8+ with Jupyter installed
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Valid OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4 and DALL-E
3. **Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install crewai
   pip install crewai-tools
   pip install langchain-openai
   pip install ipython
   pip install requests
   ```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure API Key**:
   Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   Or set it in your Jupyter environment.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DallEAGENT.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. **Execute All Cells**: Run all cells in sequence to set up the agents and workflow
2. **Generate Content**: The system will automatically:
   - Create a funny fairy tale concept
   - Generate a detailed image description
   - Produce a DALL-E generated image
3. **View Results**: The final output includes both the story and a link to the generated image

## Workflow Process

The system follows a sequential workflow:

1. **Story Creation**: The Fairy Tale Twister generates a humorous story concept
2. **Image Conceptualization**: The Concept Artist creates a detailed image description
3. **Image Generation**: The Image Generator uses DALL-E to create the final image

## Output Format

The system produces:
- A creative fairy tale story with a modern twist
- A detailed image description optimized for DALL-E
- A generated image URL that can be displayed or downloaded

## Customization

You can customize the system by:

- **Modifying Agent Roles**: Change the backstory and goals of each agent
- **Adjusting Task Descriptions**: Modify the creative prompts and requirements
- **Adding New Tools**: Integrate additional AI tools or APIs
- **Changing Output Format**: Modify the expected output formats

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
2. **DALL-E Access**: Verify your OpenAI account has access to DALL-E
3. **Package Dependencies**: Make sure all required packages are installed correctly
4. **Image Display**: If images don't display, check the URL accessibility

### Error Handling

- The system includes verbose logging to help debug issues
- Check the agent outputs for detailed error messages
- Verify network connectivity for API calls

## Example Output

The system generates creative content like:
- **Story**: "Little Red Riding Hood orders takeout and the Big Bad Wolf becomes a delivery driver"
- **Image**: A detailed description of the scene for DALL-E
- **Result**: A humorous illustration of the modern fairy tale twist
